FIRST AID

2
first aid
This booklet contains information and guidelines for providing 
first aid in an emergency. It cannot cover every situation, so 
the guidance is of a general nature. The suggested behaviours 
and measures must be applied taking account of:
•   local requirements; 
•   available resources;
•   effective local practices, if any; and 
•   access to and the capacity of further care.
The ICRC therefore declines all responsibility in the event 
that  the  recommendations  do  not  correspond  to  the  best  
course of action in a given situation. 
First aid is the first essential help given in an emergency in 
order  to  preserve  life,  prevent  further  injury  or  illness  and 
relieve  suffering  in  order  to  contribute  to  recovery.  These 
objectives should be achieved:
•    without harm, either physical or psychological, to yourself, 
to the casualty or to others; and 
•   within your limits, be they emotional, physical, technical or 
material.

first aid
Your  ability  to  manage  an  emergency  and  to  care  for  a 
wounded or sick person safely and effectively (beyond just 
treating the injury or condition) can be enhanced by seeking 
the assistance of others present at the scene and by using 
resources available on the spot.
Sometimes, further care may be required. In those cases, 
the casualty will need to be transported in a safe and timely 
manner to an appropriate care provider.
You can save lives 
(or help to do so) 
by acting immediately, 
safely and humanely
We  urge  you  to  take  a  first-aid  course.  Contact  the  ICRC 
delegation or the National Red Cross or Red Crescent Society 
in your country to find out if they offer such courses or other 
support that will help boost your confidence and refresh/enhance 
your skills. In this way you will be better able to act safely, 
humanely and effectively in an emergency.

respect for Wounded and sick and health care
It is important to:
•   respect and protect the wounded and sick, and actively 
support and facilitate their access to health care;
•   respect and protect health-care personnel, facilities and 
medical transports, whether civilian or military, regardless 
of which side they belong to; 
•   respect the humanitarian and impartial character of health 
care;
•   ensure that health-care personnel, facilities and medical 
transports remain exclusively engaged in medical tasks;
•   refrain from denying or disrupting health care as a military 
tactic;
•   respect the distinctive emblems of the red cross,  
red crescent and red crystal, and refrain from using them 
improperly.

22
respect for the red cross and red crescent
During both peacetime and emergencies, National Red Cross 
and  Red  Crescent  Societies  and  the  ICRC  offer  first-aid 
training and, where needed, provide first aid directly, making 
no discrimination as to nationality, race, religious beliefs, class 
or political opinions. 
Red Cross and Red Crescent first-aiders endeavour to save 
lives and relieve the suffering of individuals, being guided 
solely by their needs and giving priority to the most urgent 
cases of distress. First-aiders do not take sides in hostilities or 
engage  at  any  time  in  controversies  of  a  political,  racial, 
religious or ideological nature. They provide first aid or training 
on a voluntary basis, in no way motivated by a desire for gain.
Red Cross and Red Crescent first-aiders wear a distinctive 
emblem for their identification and protection. They must be 
respected and supported in their humanitarian activities, be 
it in peacetime or emergencies.

international huManitarian laW
In time of war, certain rules must be observed, even with 
regard to the enemy. These rules are set out mainly in the 
four Geneva Conventions of 1949 and their three Additional 
Protocols of 1977 and 2005.
As at July 2015, 196 States are party to the four Geneva 
Conventions, 174 party to Additional Protocol I, 168 party to 
Additional Protocol II and 72 party to Additional Protocol III. 
As  a  State  party  to  the  Geneva  Conventions  and  their 
Additional Protocols, your country is bound by these treaties.
These  treaties  are  founded  on  the  idea  of  respect  for  the  
individual  and  his/her  dignity.  Persons  not  taking  a  direct 
part in the fighting and those no longer taking part because 
of  sickness,  injury,  captivity,  or  any  other  cause,  must  be 
respected and protected against the effects of war; those who 
suffer must be aided and cared for without discrimination. 
Special  protection  is  to  be  given  to  medical  personnel, 
hospitals and medical transports as well as to Red Cross/
Red Crescent personnel, buildings and equipment.
The four Geneva Conventions protect the following categories 
of persons:
•   wounded and sick members of the armed forces in the 
field and medical personnel (Convention I);
•   wounded, sick and shipwrecked members of the armed 
forces at sea (Convention II);
•   prisoners of war (Convention III);
•   civilians in the power of the enemy or in an occupied territory 
(Convention IV).
Article  3  common  to  all  four  Geneva  Conventions,  which 

13
international huManitarian laW
regulates  internal  conflicts,  provides  for  the  humane 
treatment  of  all  persons  who  are  not  or  no  longer  taking 
part in the fighting. In particular, Article 3 prohibits inhuman 
treatment, hostage-taking, torture and arbitrary executions 
and stipulates that trials must afford all judicial guarantees. 
Protocol I and Protocol II regulate in greater detail international 
and internal conflicts respectively.
During hostilities, a distinction must be made between civilians 
and civilian objects and military objectives.

14
The States party to the Geneva Conventions pledge to:
•   care for the wounded on an equal basis, regardless of 
whether they are friends or enemies;
•   respect the physical integrity, honour, dignity, family rights, 
and moral and religious convictions of civilians and of 
those no longer taking part in the fighting;
•   prohibit torture and inhuman treatment, summary 
executions or extermination, deportation, hostage-taking, 
looting, and destruction of civilian objects;
•   allow ICRC delegates to visit detainees held in relation to 
the conflict and to talk to them in private.

ICRC
15
icrc
The  International  Committee  of  the  Red  Cross  (ICRC)  is 
an  impartial,  neutral  and  independent  organization  whose 
exclusively humanitarian mission is to protect the lives and 
dignity of victims of armed conflict and other situations of 
violence  and  to  provide  them  with  assistance.  The  ICRC 
also  endeavours  to  prevent  suffering  by  promoting  and 
strengthening humanitarian law and universal humanitarian 
principles. Established in 1863, the ICRC is at the origin of 
the  Geneva  Conventions  and  the  International  Red  Cross 
and Red Crescent Movement. It directs and coordinates the 
international activities conducted by the Movement in armed 
conflicts and other situations of violence.

16
Visits to detainees
The purpose of the ICRC’s activities in places of detention 
is to ensure that detainees are treated humanely and their 
dignity is respected.
As part of a confidential dialogue with the authorities, the 
ICRC makes recommendations on detainees’ treatment and 
conditions of detention.
In addition, the ICRC provides the detaining authorities with 
material  or  technical  support  or,  where  needed,  delivers 
services directly to the detainees.
The ICRC works with the authorities at all levels, from prison 
guards to national leaders.

17
criteria for Visits
Whether or not it is dealing with a situation covered by the 
Geneva Conventions, the ICRC applies the same criteria to 
its activities for detainees, i.e.:
•   its delegates must have access 
to all detainees and be able to 
speak to them freely and without 
witness;
•   they must have access to all 
places  of  detention  and  be  
allowed to repeat the visits;
•   they must be given lists of all 
persons  to  be  visited  (or  be 
able to draw up such lists on the 
spot).

18
the icrc’s central tracing agency
The  ICRC’s  Central  Tracing  Agency  –  in  cooperation  with 
National  Red  Cross  and  Red  Crescent  Societies  –  works 
around the globe to assist persons separated from their loved 
ones. In armed conflicts and other situations of violence, its 
tasks are to:
•  when normal means of communication are disrupted, 
put family members in contact with one another through 
phone calls, the Family Links website, radio broadcasts 
and hand-written messages;
•  trace missing persons in order to assist them and let their 
families know where they are;
•  register and keep track of vulnerable individuals such 
as children and detainees in order to prevent their 
disappearance and to inform their families of their 
whereabouts;
•  reunite dispersed family members and organize transfers 
and repatriations;
•  help clarify the fate and whereabouts of missing persons 
and ensure that the needs of their families are met.
