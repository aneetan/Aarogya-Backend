first aid
Your  ability  to  manage  an  emergency  and  to  care  for  a 
wounded or sick person safely and effectively (beyond just 
treating the injury or condition) can be enhanced by seeking 
the assistance of others present at the scene and by using 
resources available on the spot.
Sometimes, further care may be required. In those cases, 
the casualty will need to be transported in a safe and timely 
manner to an appropriate care provider.
You can save lives 
(or help to do so) 
by acting immediately, 
safely and humanely
We  urge  you  to  take  a  first-aid  course.  Contact  the  ICRC 
delegation or the National Red Cross or Red Crescent Society 
in your country to find out if they offer such courses or other 
support that will help boost your confidence and refresh/enhance 
your skills. In this way you will be better able to act safely, 
humanely and effectively in an emergency.

cooperation of the 
casualty. Examine 
him/her thoroughly.

respect for Wounded and sick and health care
It is important to:
•   respect and protect the wounded and sick, and actively 
support and facilitate their access to health care;
•   respect and protect health-care personnel, facilities and 
medical transports, whether civilian or military, regardless 
of which side they belong to; 
•   respect the humanitarian and impartial character of health 
care;
•   ensure that health-care personnel, facilities and medical 
transports remain exclusively engaged in medical tasks;
•   refrain from denying or disrupting health care as a military 
tactic;
•   respect the distinctive emblems of the red cross,  
red crescent and red crystal, and refrain from using them 
improperly.

22
respect for the red cross and red crescent
During both peacetime and emergencies, National Red Cross 
and  Red  Crescent  Societies  and  the  ICRC  offer  first-aid 
training and, where needed, provide first aid directly, making 
no discrimination as to nationality, race, religious beliefs, class 
or political opinions. 
Red Cross and Red Crescent first-aiders endeavour to save 
lives and relieve the suffering of individuals, being guided 
solely by their needs and giving priority to the most urgent 
cases of distress. First-aiders do not take sides in hostilities or 
engage  at  any  time  in  controversies  of  a  political,  racial, 
religious or ideological nature. They provide first aid or training 
on a voluntary basis, in no way motivated by a desire for gain.
Red Cross and Red Crescent first-aiders wear a distinctive 
emblem for their identification and protection. They must be 
respected and supported in their humanitarian activities, be 
it in peacetime or emergencies.
